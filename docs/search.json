Previously he had been King of Prussia; now, he was emperor of a united Germany. German states—Saxony, Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Prussia, and others—27 in all—retained some local powers of government, in a federal structure like the United States, with a national legislature in two parts, a lower house—the Reichstag—and an upper house—the Bundesrat. But all were under the Prussian throne, which was now the German throne. Prussia had enough votes in the Bundesrat (17 of 58) to block any legislation, and the kaiser had control of foreign policy and commanded the army."
