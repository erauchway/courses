The US had refused to recognize the legitimacy of Mao’s government in China since it was established in 1949, insisting that the exiled Chiang kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) was the proper ruler of China. But in attempting to bring to a close the war in Vietnam, and to end the fearsome costs to the United States Treasury that the war entailed, Nixon and Kissinger decided to open up relations to China. Kissinger traveled to China secretly in 1971; the UN voted to allow China to take a seat in the general assembly; and in 1972, Nixon visited, as you see here, together with Kissinger. It was the beginning of an opening in Sino-Soviet relations, of the US deciding to consider that Taiwan was a Chinese problem for China to solve, and of trade agreements. \n\nIt also risked making the Russians nervous. \n\nBrezhnev succeeded Khrushchev as Soviet premier in 1964 and was worried about Soviet economic weakness by 1971. The USSR still had a strong military, and it continued its military buildup and its peacetime draft, with an army of 5m men standing ready. But Brezhnev was worried about Eastern Europe, which had growing numbers of dissidents, eager for the prosperity and freedoms of the West. He wanted to relax restrictions on travel through the Berlin Wall, and he wanted Nixon to agree to it. He was also worried about the Sino-US opening, and wanted to make it possible for the US to deal directly with him rather than solely with Mao. And his economy was so weak, he hoped to do a deal to buy wheat from the Americans. He managed to achieve all of these things, as well as an arms deal. \n\nThis policy continued through the Carter administration, as well as some other legacies of Vietnam---including inflation, which is what Reagan ran against in 1980, as you heard.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## The Bear and the Budget\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.columns .v-center-container}\n\n:::{.column}\n![](../media/def_budg.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.column}\n![](../media/bear_still.png)\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo, it’s a strong national defense, or at least it's an expensive one. Reagan ran as a conservative, pledging to cut down the federal government. But he really didn’t: he cut anti-poverty programs, while increasing defense spending. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Not much change\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](h187_25_reagan_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn fact, if you look at federal spending per person, there’s hardly a blip—maybe there’s not even a blip—with the Reagan administration; it’s pretty smoothly upwards. \n\nInasmuch as Reagan also cut taxes, that meant that the federal government had to borrow more money—so there’s a definite spike in that, just not in the spending.\n\nIn sum, in the 1980s, the U.S. government paid for lower taxes and increased defense spending with borrowed money.\n:::\n:::\n\n## [National Association of Evangelicals]{.r-fit-text}\nMarch 1983\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n```{=revealjs}\n<video>\n<source src=../media/better_dead.mp4>\n</video>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nAnd Reagan began his time in office by moving away from détente—by re-emphasizing the centrality of the Cold War to his belief system.\n\n(literally, better dead than red)\n:::\n:::\n\n## [National Association of Evangelicals]{.r-fit-text}\nMarch 1983\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n```{=revealjs}\n<video>\n<source src=../media/evil_empire.mp4>\n</video>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\n“evil empire”\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Strategic Defense Initiative\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}\nI call upon the Scientific Community in this country, who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering these weapons obsolete\n\n:::{.flushright}\nRonald Reagan, 1983\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nWith the reaction to that speech in mind, Reagan and his aides tried to come up with something less aggressive-sounding.  Strategic Defense Initiative—SDI.  “political payoff”  Reagan came up with this sentence himself, apparently—Fitgerald, 207.\n\nShultz:  “We don’t have the technology to say this” / “It’s more than a news item.  It’s a sweeping proposal”  Reagan:  wanted speech to say nuclear weapons would be “obsolete”  \n\nMany in his administration disliked the idea; understood SDI as a potential threat to MAD, and possibly a first-strike capability.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Mikhail Gorbachev\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/gorby_thatch.png){width=\"550\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/gorby_thatch.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nBrezhnev died 1982; he was succeeded by Andropov, who died in 1984, and Chernenko, who died in 1985. It was the end of the old Bolsheviks, as a generation and as a set of tactics. \n\nGorbachev, who came to power 1985, first SU leader born after revolution. On taking office he realized the Stalinist tactics had weakened the economy, not only because of traditionalist Marxist economic disadvantages, but because the effort to control information had severely hampered the USSR. The old Stalinists had limited the number of copiers and personal computers, because they posed a threat in terms of personal control of data. By the middle 1980s, the US had 30m personal computers and the USSR had 50k. \n\nperestroika was an economic restructuring; glasnost political openness\n\nEarly on, MG tells M. Thatcher he can’t solve SU’s economic problems without ending arms race. So to fit this with your reading, you should know that Reagan had begun dialing back his belligerence before this, and now Gorbachev was saying that for his part, he had to seek an end to the arms race—he was feeling many of the same pressures Brezhnev had, only greater now.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Geneva, 1985\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/gorby_ron.png){width=\"350\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/gorby_ron.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\n\n\nAs you know again from reading, this is more symbolic than consequential, but as Nixon said about SALT, it’s a step toward a different kind of relationship. In fact, it’s a step back toward that same form of détente. Reagan proposed sharing SDI. Gorbachev asked to chuck SDI. Things didn't get very far. But Reagan regarded Gorbachev with \"warmth.\"\n\nhttp://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/photographs/large/c32025-25.jpg\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Reykjavik, 1986\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/ron_gorby.png){width=\"450\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/ron_gorby.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn 1986, they meet in Reykjavik.

In 2007, Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia’s interests, though took no official action; in 2018, Trump declared the US would withdraw from the treaty\n\nNow, at least part of the reason for Reagan’s enthusiasm for peacemaking was the effort to get out from under the cloud of Central American policy.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Nicaragua\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/nicaragua.png){width=\"850\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/nicaragua.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn 1979, a Nicaraguan guerrilla army known as the Sandinistas, after Augusto Sandino, the revolutionary leader of the 1920s and 1930s, finally succeeded in overthrowing the government of Antonio Somoza, a West Point-educated, US-backed dictator. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Iran\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/iran.png){width=\"850\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/iran.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nAt about the same time, an anti-US, largely Muslim-clerical revolution was successful at overthrowing the Shah in Iran, whom you will remember had been placed in power by the CIA in the 1950s—again, this should be familiar to you from your reading.\n\nMost notably you may remember that during this revolution the Iranians occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took many of the workers there hostage, holding them through the remainder of Jimmy Carter’s presidency, releasing them upon the inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Aid to Contras\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/contra_aid.png){width=\"850\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\" .column-margin}\n![](../media/contra_aid.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe Sandinista regime faced a counterrevolutionary threat from an a guerrilla army known as the Contras. Under Reagan, the CIA began supporting the Contras. Special helicopter squadrons were formed in the US, particularly in Tampa, Florida, to support operations in Central America. (This one has the planks and the Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System (FRIES) system.)\n\nWhen Congress found out about the secret war the US was waging in Nicaragua, it outlawed that war, writing specifically into Defense appropriations law, passed unanimously by the House and signed into law by President Reagan, that US money and resources could not be used to overthrow the Sandinista regime. It’s quite likely that no such law could have been passed were it not for the revelations of the 1975 Church Committee. In the wake of Watergate, Congress began asserting its prerogatives to demand information on the secret operations of the executive branch. Many of the episodes of the postwar era, some of which we’ve discussed in here, that remained secret until then were revealed to the public, including coups, coup attempts, assassinations, and assassination attempts. \n\nDespite that law, Reagan’s administration continued to bomb and otherwise fight on behalf of the Contras, including mining the harbors of Nicaragua - a violation of international law.\n\nCongress continued each year to pass a version of the Boland Amendment outlawing US aid to the Contras.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Iran-Contra\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n- US aircraft parts and missiles through Israel to Iran, for cash\n- cash, through Panama and Honduras, to the Contras\n- US replenishment of weapons to Israel\n::::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nFor many people, Iran-Contra is referred to as a scandal, and indeed, once it becomes public an investigation begins in 1983, continuing through the entirety of Bush’s presidency. Quickly, the defense of those implicated, including President Bush himself, would become not that they had not broken the law, but that the law they had broken was not a proper law, because with it Congress infringed on the Executive’s prerogative to formulate and carry out foreign policy.\n\nFor our purposes, though, it’s in many ways useful to think about it as the crowning policy of US foreign relations in the Cold War: in the name of an ideologically informed struggle against a leftist administration in Central America, in the course of attempting to get leverage with the Arab and Muslim countries of the Middle East, the US is using weapons, foreign aid, and puppet or allied regimes to subvert international law and, in this case, domestic law.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n# Quiz{visibility=\"uncounted\"}\n\n\n## [1.
