It will appear sometime after class, so I can be sure it has in it the things I actually got around to showing in lecture, and not things I didn't. And because it won't have any material I didn't make---because of copyright---it won't replicate the experience of being in class. That is, it won't save you from taking notes. But it might serve as a useful outline, which you can fill in from your notes. \nAnd, as I say, it will have any maps and charts that I make. Like this one.\n\nLet's consider first of all the projection (what's a projection) and why this one.\n\nThen, let's do some fun iClicker.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n### 1.
