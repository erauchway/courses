There are elements of both eras here. This is of course in its way an artificial thing to say, but it is also the kind of thing historians say, because there are useful insights to be got from making up these categories of analysis and playing around with them. So we have seen the end of a c19 style of warfare and the beginning of a c20 style of warfare, both on the battlefront and in terms of treatment of civilian populations; we have seen a bit about the rise of new ideologies and radicalism, and we will see quite a bit more. And we have talked about the ways in which we’re looking at the end of the c19 empires. This was a conflict in many ways precipitated by the fact of empires—by Germany’s desire to be one, by the Ottomans’ and Austrians’ desire to keep one—and how its progress is characterized by the logic and geography of empires, especially insofar as British naval interests and access to India and Asia is concerned.\n  \n  VIDEO WILL START\"\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## [They're all British, those Isles, right?]{.r-fit-text}\n\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video ../media/murphy_crop.mp4 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Europe on the eve of war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](h119_easter_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nAll right, here’s our map of Europe on the eve of the war. We’re going to look today at the big islands off the coast of France, there, generally—but not without controversy—referred to as the British Isles. In Britain today, they are often referred to as “these islands” in order to be diplomatic. Why the fuss? Because although today, there is more than one national government in those islands, there was not then, and therein lies a tale.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Britain and its nearby colony\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/gb.png){width=\"350\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nHere we have a map of the British Isles on the eve of war, showing the main island of Britain as well as the Orkneys and Shetlands, which we’ve already discussed, and the Isle of Wight, which you’ll know if you know your Beatles songs. Here on the West of England is the Irish Sea, and across that, an island of its own, is Ireland. Only at most about 150 miles away from England and in many places much closer, Ireland fell prey to conquest across that sea fairly early. \n\nThe Normans who conquered England beginning in 1066 conquered Ireland in the 12th century. In 1541, the Irish Parliament gave Henry VIII the title of King of Ireland as well as King of England, and from then until the twentieth century the two rulers were the same. \n\nHenry had by that time already been the head of the Church of England for seven years—that is to say, he was a Protestant ruler. In the 17th century, with the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution, Protestants cemented their control over England. The sectarian unease of Protestant hegemony in England over a Catholic country in Ireland was thus assured, and lasted for centuries and indeed to the present. In 1801, the Act of Union abolished the Irish Parliament and created the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Forty or so years later, the massive famine that struck Ireland led to starvation and poverty and enormous emigration, largely to the United States, beginning the tradition of an Irish diaspora that includes New York and Boston, among other cities, as homes to many Irish and their descendants.\n:::\n:::\n\n## The four fifths & home rule\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/four.png){width=\"500\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nAnd here we are, looking just at Ireland alone, as it was just before the war. The four provinces in Ireland are called in the Irish language a word that means “fifth,” of course because there are four of them. (There used to be five.) \n\nYou can see Dublin there, on the East coast. Belfast is almost due North of there, with the bulk of Ireland stretching away West.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century you saw the rise of Irish nationalist sentiments, as in other European nations like—as we’ve seen—Italy, Germany, among still others, began to define themselves in terms of shared language, religion, culture, and other traditions, rather than by the crown that happened to rule them. \n\nIn Ireland nationalism was virtually synonymous with republicanism—that is, the desire to throw off the monarchy and establish in Ireland a representative government, with the Irish language, and Irish laws.  1858 saw the founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and shortly afterward, its American counterpart, the Fenian Brotherhood, both secret fraternal societies devoted to Irish independence. The story of Irish nationalism is, like many nationalisms, an ironically international story, with a tremendous amount of support for the cause—both moral and substantial—coming from overseas, and in the Irish case, particularly from America. Americans entertained Irish nationalists in the United States; they bought bonds to support the nationalist cause, and they ensured the Fenians could acquire guns as well.\n\nOver time the Irish gradually gained more control over their affairs. In 1867, the Anglican Church in Ireland was disestablished and in 1874 the Irish Parliamentary Party was established, to run candidates to sit in the British Parliament at Westminster. So you now have a version of Irish nationalism that's partly contained within the British system of government. \n\nThe rise of the Irish Parliamentary Party at Westminster permitted the advocacy within the British Parliamentary system of some kind of devolution of power. As is the case with the Scottish Nationalist Party in Westminster today, the presence of this party and its votes became a variable that politicians in the British capital sometimes had to take into account. At its peak in the 1880s, under the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Party frequently had enough seats to obstruct legislation. And they often did deals with the Liberal party to put the Liberals in power, in exchange for Home Rule legislation.\n\nIn the 1880s, the Liberal Prime Minister, William Gladstone, supported the idea of an Irish assembly, to which some, chiefly domestic, powers would be devolved. Gladstone’s 1886 home rule bill was narrowly defeated, and led to the fall of the Liberal government. \n\nWhen the Liberals returned to power in 1906, they had a large enough majority they didn’t need to worry about the Irish Party, but with the 1911 elections, the Liberals lost ground, leaving the Irish Party in a position once again to break tie votes and thus to ask for support. This was the Liberal government, the Asquith government, which we’ve already seen was in power during the first part of the Great War. So the government of Britain can only retain its authority if it has the support of the Irish parliamentary party, which it certainly wants, because it prefers to focus on the war.\n:::\n:::\n\n## [Home rule & sectarian division]{.r-fit-text}\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/sect.png){width=\"500\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn the discussions over home rule, the  sectarian division within Ireland became more clearly a political geographical division, as a majority of those Irish in Ulster, in the chiefly Protestant North, had no interest in separating from the UK, while a majority of those in the more Catholic South, did. The fact of loyalist Ulster quickly became, and indeed remains, a site—both literal and metaphorical—for conflict over the issue of Irish independence. UK leaders who want to oppose Irish independence without seeming to support colonialism tout court can always style themselves as protectors of Ulster.\n\nOver the first years of Asquith’s premiership, the government’s desire to reach some kind of Home Rule accommodation was frequently held up by Ulster resistance. Loyalist Ulstermen formed a paramilitary group. Our ubiquitous friend Winston Churchill chimed in here, saying that the Ulster opposition was a “treasonable conspiracy”—you see them here, gathered in September 1913 at the Agricultural Show Grounds in Balmoral, unveiling their own flag and declaring their intention to resist any home rule. \n\nEarly in 1914, Asquith proposed giving Ulster an option to stay outside Home Rule for 6 years, if it went through, but that wasn’t good enough for those of Ulster who saw it as a suspended sentence. \n\nIn reaction to unionist intransigence in the North, a similar paramilitary was formed in the South – the Irish Volunteers of November 1913. So you already had the pattern of conflict: Home Rule as a liberal devolution, acceptable to the majority of Southern Catholics, but so objectionable to the militant Ulstermen that they would sooner take up arms, and generate a reaction in the South. This reaction wasn’t limited to paramilitary drilling.\n:::\n:::\n\n## The revolution-to-be\n\n:::{.callout-caution appearance=minimal .v-center-container}\nThere will be in the Ireland of the next few years a multitudinous activity of Freedom Clubs, Young Republican Clubs, Labour Organizations, Socialist groups, and what not; bewildering enterprises undertaken by sane persons and insane persons, many of them seemingly contradictory, some mutually destructive, yet all tending towards a common objective, and that objective: the Irish Revolution.\n\n:::{.flushright}\nPatrick Pearse\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nThere grew together a number of cultural and political organizations all aimed at this one nationalist outcome, and to some extent the organization, Sinn Féin (we ourselves), included them all, boycotting British goods, abstaining from Westminster, and drawing up local plans for Irish institutions in defiance of Britain. \n\nThe multifarious revolution became that much more attractive in 1914, when home rule was granted, with an Ulster exclusion, and simultaneously suspended, on September 18, 1914, so that the Government would not be distracted by the Irish issue while it turned its attention to continental Europe. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Majority view\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/majority.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nNow we should stop here to note that Pearse represented the view of a tiny minority, \"a minority of a minority,\" as historian Roy Foster says. The bulk of Irish nationalists were not revolutionaries. The bulk of them supported the British cause and the defense of Belgium in the war. The Irish National Volunteers, the paramilitary group supporting Home Rule, were quite likely to enlist—and they formed the bulk of the 16th division of the British Army, which fought at the Somme; you can see them here. The leader of the Irish National Party at this time, John Redmond, a member of the British Parliament, supported this strategy.\n\nIt was a splinter group of the National Volunteers, about 12,000 of their approximately 180,000, who declined to join, and they represented the view that the Irish should not support a British war. but should organize only to defend Ireland. Nevertheless, it wasn't them, either, who were Pearse's revolutionaries. That was a very small group, mainly socialist in outlook—maybe a few hundred men at the time of Easter, 1916. \n\nhttp://www.sommeassociation.com/history/16th-irish-division\n:::\n:::\n\n## Guns\n\n:::{.callout-caution appearance=minimal .v-center-container}\n… before we can intervene, or even pretend to intervene, in the crisis to any purpose we must have guns. Hence the one great urgent duty of the hour, the duty which overshadows every other duty, is to get guns and ammunition into the country. It is up to the American Committee to act at once and on a large scale.\n\n:::{.flushright}\nPatrick Pearse\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nPearse soon became known as the commander in chief of the Army of the Irish Republic, as his group began to style themselves. As he said here, \n:::\n:::\n\n## German gambit\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/libau.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn connection with Pearse and the Irish volunteers, a former British diplomat knighted by Queen Victoria, the Irish-born Sir Roger Casement, began negotiating with the Germans for aid to the Irish rebels, of the kind Pearse desired. Casement is regarded as one of the founders of the modern human rights movement, having investigated and reported on abuses under Belgian rule in Congo. \n\nDuring the war, he went to Germany and worked from there to subvert the British empire. He was involved not only in the attempt to arm Irish nationalists but also, it's worth noting, an unsuccessful effort to promote an Indian nationalist uprising against the British as well—an effort, like Irish nationalism, that was also linked to the United States, and which the British ultimately prevailed on the United States government to put down.\n\nA German ship called the Libau, disguised as the Norwegian Aud, ran the British blockade, arriving on Holy Thursday in April of 1916 in Tralee Bay carrying 20,000 rifles, 10 machine guns and a million rounds. But there was nobody there to unload it. The Irish nationalists didn’t realize when the ship would get there. Its cargo was seized or destroyed. Casement himself was arrested.\n\nPearse and the other Irish volunteers decided, in the manner of many a general in the Great War, to go ahead with their plan anyway, even though its first step had failed, because as it was they had plenty of arms they had got from the United States.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Liberty Hall, Dublin\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/liberty.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nHere is Liberty Hall, in Dublin, the headquarters of the Volunteers. As you can see on the banner, it says, “We serve neither King nor Kaiser, but Ireland.” \n\nHere, on Easter Sunday 1916, a group of leaders of Sinn Féin decided they would go ahead without the weapons on the Libau/Aud, and fight for independence with the assorted arms they had on hand. They decided Patrick Pearse should have the title of the first president of the Irish Republic. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Irish volunteers\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/irish_vols.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nAnd on Monday after Easter, just before noon, a group of this self-styled army began marching from Liberty Hall up O’Connell Street. Some of them had taken the tram to get there, paying full fare, but also commanding the driver, at gunpoint, to take them there without stopping. One passenger complained that a volunteer kept hitting her with his rifle butt and demanded of the driver that he put them off. \"Perhaps you wouldn't mind doing it for me, ma'am.”\n\nMany of them were Irishmen who had been living in England, and who decided to go back to Ireland to fight for rebellion rather than to fight for the English in France.\n:::\n:::\n\n## General Post Office\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/gpo.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThey were going to the General Post Office, or GPO. The GPO was no humble building, as you can see. Built in the early c19, to a solid, neoclassical style, it was taller than its surroundings, and commanded the neighborhood.\n\nThe Army of the Irish Republic marched up the street, with Pearse at the head. It attracted little alarm; by this point the volunteers had marched any number of times without attracting concerns. So even the few British soldiers in the streets let them pass peaceably. When the Irish arrived at the GPO, though, they halted, and then received a command from their leaders to charge in and take it from the bewildered bureaucrats inside. \n\nThey tore it to pieces fortifying it, putting sacks of mail, furniture, blank forms, and files in front of the windows, hoping to stop incoming bullets.\n\nThere was a detachment of British soldiers set to guard the GPO, but the IRA were easily able to take them prisoners because, since they were only guarding the post office and there was a war on, they had not been allocated any ammunition. This is just as the British Expeditionary Force in Europe is beginning its ramp-up to the Somme offensive.\n\nSome of the volunteers ran down from Liberty Hall with the flags of the Irish Republic, and the volunteers ran down the British flags, running these up instead, including the tricolor, with the Green for the South, the Orange for the North, and the white stripe of purity in between.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Declaration\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/declare.png){width=\"300\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThey issued this declaration: “We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies… Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.”\n\nIf you've ever heard the word \"provo\" used to refer to a member of the IRA, this is the idea behind that. \n\nnote the \"exiled children in America\" and the \"gallant allies in Europe.\"\n\nSo here, you have a vital question: what do you do if you’re Britain? The thing to do might have been to grant Home Rule, then this becomes an Irish problem for Irish solutions. Or indeed, of course, on the analogy with the Western Front, not to have colonized Ireland in the first instance. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Charge of the lancers\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/lancers.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nA British army detachment of Lancers was stationed nearby. They formed up at the base of O’Connell Street, and then charged up the street at the post office. The men in the GPO, asked for the first time to defend themselves, fired and were able to hit a number of lancers and their horses, disrupting the charges, and forcing the lancers into retreat, the British soldiers having never fired a shot.\n\nAnd then for a long time there were no British troops visible anywhere nearby. The IRA collected their munitions and other supplies from Liberty Hall, and looted some material from nearby stores. They inspired a number of local civilians to do the same. Realizing there were now going to be no policemen or soldiers anywhere nearby, the Dubliners seized their chance to break down and clean out the storefronts of the neighborhood.\n:::\n:::\n\n## No mail today\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/no_mail.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nTuesday morning came. Some people in Dublin still hadn’t quite grasped what was going on. \"Go home, there's no mail today. \"Why not? It's a Tuesday.\" \"There's a revolution on, that's why not.\" \"Since when is there no mail of a Tuesday?\" \"Since yesterday.\" \"But yesterday was a Monday.\" \"You heard me say there was no mail. Now will you feck off? Go home!” keep in mind, many of these were separation women, whose husbands were serving in the British Army, who were coming to the GPO to collect their allowances. \n\nThe IRA continued to build barricades and otherwise shore up their position. They wanted to dispel the looters around the GPO but hadn’t the manpower, even though guerrillas retreating from other positions in the city were coming to join them. The British were still taking their time getting around to the GPO. \n:::\n:::\n\n## Naval combat\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/liffey.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nEarly on Wednesday it became clear that the British had access to big guns. The sound of firing was audible in the GPO bright and early—though not too nearby. It eventually emerged that the British had brought a gunboat as far as they could up the River Liffey, and they were bombarding Liberty Hall. Although it had been the insurgent HQ, hardly anyone or anything remained there, though. (note where the river narrows, and the GPO being a bit further) \n:::\n:::\n\n## Bombardment of Liberty Hall\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/liberty2.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nDespite its no longer being of great value as a target, the British gunners destroyed Liberty Hall. One of the Irish leaders, James Connolly, was astounded. He was enough of a Marxist that he did not believe, could not believe, and had often stated his firm disbelief that the British would never use artillery in the city for fear of destroying the property of the bourgeoisie and other capitalists. Yet here they were. Connolly had in effect believed in liberal imperialism, but now he was seeing the stick.\n\nThe British began to move into position to fire at the GPO, knowing the Irish would have men on the roof. They began shooting at the roof whenever they could get the angle. A priest came to the roof to give absolution for their sins to the men up there. Pearse went up to lend support, walking from station to station; finally one of his men said, “will you for god’s sake sir get your head down before they blow it off”. He would not; Pearse had a kind of mystical belief in the value of bloodshed and martyrdom to the cause. \n\nAt length the British were able to bring artillery within range of the GPO and began to shell it and nearby buildings, aided by machine gun fire. In the evening, many of the buildings along the neighboring streets caught fire, and there was no way they could be put out; no fire brigade was coming into the middle of a war zone to stop a fire.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Artillery in urban warfare\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/liffey.png){width=\"600\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe British were able to set up big guns at Trinity College, and from there could fire on the Post Office. They were able, too, to begin advancing up the street, covered by machine gun fire. In other words, the Irish were largely done for. One of the men asked one of the leaders whether they'd be shot or hanged. \"Probably hanged,\" he said. \"The English love hanging.\" But, maybe not? \"Maybe not. In the middle of a war, a rebellion like this, they'd possibly just shoot us.”\n\nPearse gave a final speech to the men, saying they might yet \"win in death\" and that they had established Ireland's right to be a Republic and to sit at the peace table at the end of the European war. In the night again the fires raged closer. \n\nOn Friday at about noon, the British began to shell the GPO in greater earnest, having installed artillery at closer range. They fired incendiary bombs to the roof. The insurgents weren't able to put out the fire. Eventually, for fear of the ammunition they had exploding, or for being burned, the men were forced out into the streets, some to be shot. The fire reached the ammunition stores in the GPO at 3 am on Saturday and exploded them.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Surrender\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/surrender.png){width=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nPearse agreed to an unconditional surrender at 3:45 in the afternoon. The British soldiers led the IRA away. They were attacked by a mob of Irish citizens throwing tomatoes, angry at how much damage and loss of life they had caused. Pearse and others were confident they would one day be remembered as heroes. But for the moment, \"Do you think they'll let us go?\" \"Bejasus, I hope not.” Again, it's important to recall that they were a tiny and possibly eccentric—remember, Pearse had said \"insane\"—minority.\n\nWithin twelve days, the insurgent leaders, including Patrick Pearse, were court-martialed and executed by firing squads. James Connolly was suffering from gangrene, and he had to be sat up on a chair to be shot.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Execution\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n![](../media/casement.png){width=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nRoger Casement was executed August 3, in England, by hanging.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Publicity\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=revealjs}\n<video muted loop width=\"600\">\n<source src=../media/dublin.mov>\n</video>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nHere you can see film of the destruction wrought in central Dublin by the fighting, even though it lasted only a short time.\n\nDespite this, it does seem that Pearse’s prediction came true. The summary execution of the leaders came to seem like a martyrdom and the cause of the Republic gained in popularity. The IRA resumed hostilities in 1919, ending in a treaty with the British in 1921, and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, from which Ulster (Northern Ireland) excepted itself.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Nationalism\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n>I write it out in a verse—\n>\n>MacDonagh and MacBride\n>\n>And Connolly and Pearse\n>\n>Now and in time to be,\n>\n>Wherever green is worn,\n>\n>Are changed, changed utterly:\n>\n>A terrible beauty is born.\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIt's striking how much could be made of so little. The British army lost 120 killed and about 400 wounded; the Irish lost about 60. Maybe 180 civilians also died. It wasn't a very large conflict. But it had outsized symbolism. \n\nSo as we’ve said there’s another story about nationalism here, stirred up and encouraged by the Germans to undermine the British, just as the British stirred up and encouraged Arab and Jewish nationalism to undermine the Ottomans. It’s a force unleashed---in part because the British, whether Liberal or not, take the view that they must crush a rebellion if they want to maintain credibility. Even if it costs them resources they'd otherwise use better elsewhere. It reveals the thinnness of the fiction of liberal imperialism. \n\n\nhttps://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/easter-rising\n:::\n:::\n\n",
