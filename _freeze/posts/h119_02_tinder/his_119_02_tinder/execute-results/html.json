Previously he had been King of Prussia; now, he was emperor of a united Germany. German states—Saxony, Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Prussia, and others—27 in all—retained some local powers of government, in a federal structure like the United States, with a national legislature in two parts, a lower house—the Reichstag—and an upper house—the Bundesrat. But all were under the Prussian throne, which was now the German throne. Prussia had enough votes in the Bundesrat (17 of 58) to block any legislation, and the kaiser had control of foreign policy and commanded the army.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## The German Reich\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![Assembling the German state](../media/reich.jpeg){width=80%}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo here’s the German Empire, or Reich, from its creation in 1871 through the Great War. Germany became very rapidly after its creation one of the major industrial powers of the Earth; between its creation and 1913 it catches up with the major industrial powers of France and Britain in terms of industrial output—in 1871, German industrial output was about half that of France and Britain and at 1913, they were all about equal.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Wilhelm II\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![Kaiser as of 1888](../media/kaiser2.jpeg){width=50%}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn 1888 the original German Kaiser died of cancer, to be replaced by his son, also Wilhelm, hence Kaiser Wilhelm II. Many people thought of him as ”not quite sane.” His mother was Victoria, the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria (and therefore known as Princess Vicky) so he was half-British, and he hated Britain. Bismarck said of him, “The Kaiser is like a balloon. If you do not hang on to the string, you never know where he will be off to.”\n\nHis principal interest was in the military, and in furthering German’s international might and ambition. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Europe\n\n\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = borders_14, fill = \"antiquewhite1\", color = \"burlywood3\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_buffer(borders_14, -6000), linewidth = 0.6, fill = NA, color = alpha(\"burlywood3\", 0.4)) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_buffer(st_union(st_make_valid(borders_14)), 6000), linewidth = 0.4, fill = NA, color = alpha(c(\"lightblue\"), 0.7)) +\n  geom_richtext(data = borders_14,\n                mapping = aes(X, Y, label = mylab),\n                size = borders_14$siz + 1,\n                family = \"Lydian\",\n                fill = NA, \n                color = \"chocolate4\",\n                label.color = NA, \n                nudge_x = borders_14$nx, \n                nudge_y = borders_14$ny, \n                na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"HIS 119---EUROPE AT 1914\",\n    caption = \"Map made using R, ggplot, and sf by Eric Rauchway with data from CShapes.\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = disp_win_coord[,'X'], ylim = disp_win_coord[, 'Y'], expand = TRUE) -> p\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](his_119_02_tinder_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nOkay, so let’s look at Europe on the eve of the war.\n\nFirst of all, to orient you from our first lecture, notice Austria-Hungary. Here, at the lower right, is the Ottoman empire, or Turkey. You can see also Turkey in Europe, covering some of the Balkan peninsula. Just north of Turkey in Europe is Bulgaria; west of that is Serbia. So if you remember all that we talked about before, there it is—where domains of the Habsburg throne, heir to the Roman Empire of the West, border on the domains of the Ottoman throne, heir to the Roman Empire of the East. That’s our flashpoint, as we’ve discussed, in the summer of 1914. \n\nOff to the Northeast or so of Austria-Hungary, there’s Germany. Now if you remember that, as I mentioned, before 1871 Germany was a series of 27 principalities, and after 1871 it became a unified and rapidly industrializing nation, you can see the reason that Germany’s rise unsettled European statesmen—even before you account for the Kaiser being like an unruly balloon. You see, when Germany was a bunch of little principalities, you had a balance. In the East was this massive Russian Empire. In the West was France—no longer as powerful as it had been in the earlier c19, when it was Napoleon I’s empire, but still a major military and industrial power. And off the coast, of course, is Britain. So there were the Western powers of Britain and France, and there were the Eastern powers of Russia and Turkey, and in between was Austria-Hungary—which, you’ll remember, had only become Austria-Hungary, rather than Austria, as an admission of weakness—and a bunch of small German-speaking states.\n\nBut now, you have a unified Germany smack in the middle of Europe, a highly educated and modernizing and military Germany, with its own interests. That’s going to shake things up. And in 1897 the Kaiser puts in his man, first as foreign minister and then as chancellor, to implement a shaking-things-up policy; that’s Bernhard von Bülow, who says he’s going to be a “tool” of the Kaiser’s personal rule. (Bismarck got sacked in 1890, replaced by Caprivi then by Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst). And the thing that von Bülow, acting as an agent for the Kaiser, is going to use to shake things up is Weltpolitik. \n\nGermany under Bismarck cements an alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879, and the two of them with Italy in 1882. You have, then, this bloc in the middle of Europe. The nations were bound to defend each other in case of an attack by Russia. So they were defending themselves against the major threat to the East. \n\nIn response to that, you get France and Russia working out an alliance in 1894. Each was then bound to defend the other in case of an attack by Germany. Russia was receiving lots of investment capital from France. It seemed like a mutually beneficial relationship.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Weltpolitik\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![The world with colonial powers shown, ca. 1910](../media/world_1910.jpeg){width=75%}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nAll right, let’s zoom out from Europe and look at the World in about 1910. And this map of the world shows the colonial possessions of the European and other powers. There are different kinds of empires on here. The Russian empire is almost entirely the massive, contiguous gray area up to the upper right. The US empire is mostly contiguous. Its discontinuities include chiefly Alaska and Hawaii, which we now don’t think of as part of the United States’ colonial possessions, because in the middle of the c20 they received statehood and became parts of the federal republic. But at this point they are considered colonial possessions, and both of them are evidence of American ambition to reach China—they’re both way stations across the Pacific, as indeed are the Philippines, which are circled there in green, as part of the US empire. So if we look at Russia, we see a principally landed empire focusing on exploiting its internal resources; if we look at the US we see a landed empire keen to export its products across the Pacific for trade. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Dreadnought, 1906\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/dreadnought.jpeg)\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThis leads, naturally, to Britain getting worried about its navy. Admiral John “Jacky” Fisher (yes, they had Princess Vicky and Admiral Jacky) backs the construction of a new class of super-battleship, the dreadnoughts – that means afraid of nothin’ – with 12-inch guns and faster speeds than the old ones. The batteries on the Dreadnought were twice the firepower from an earlier battleship, so the broadsides were twice as destructive. \n\nThis leads to a ramping-up of German naval construction. And it takes so long to build a major ship – maybe you can build two a year if you’re a major power – that it requires planning well in advance. So naval construction takes on a momentum of its own.\n\nAnd in this context, the British reach an understanding with the French and the Russians by 1907. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Triple Entente\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](his_119_02_tinder_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo, it’s not quite an Alliance, it’s more a settling of differences—the French and the British had come into conflict in Africa, over colonial possessions there—the Russians and the British had come into conflict in Asia, over colonial possessions there. This understanding put these differences in the background, and allowed the establishment of friendlier communications—with the threat of Germany and its Alliance now in the foreground for all three members.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## A spark in the tinder\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![The previously discussed spark](../media/spark.jpeg)\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo when we talked last time about the spark, and Princip’s action as being the spark, and this time we are talking about this increasingly divided, heavily armed Europe as a tinder box… tinder is stuff that easily catches fire. So if you shoot a spark into some tinder, you get a conflagration. The assassination is June 28.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Encirclement\nBlank check, ultimatum; mobilization\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](his_119_02_tinder_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe Germans now begin to feel they’ve been encircled – that they’re trapped by the British Navy and the French Army in the West, and that in the East, they’re increasingly involved in a racialized conflict between the Teutons and the Slavs. Which helps to explain why when the Austro-Hungarian police (Teutons) began to discuss and investigate the murder of the Archduke, they do so as a discussion of Serbs, which is to say a plot of Slavs, even though it also involved Muslims and others who thought of themselves as Bosnians. So when the Kaiser receives an emissary from Austro-Hungary after the assassination, on July 3 he says that Austria-Hungary should deal as they see fit with the Serbs, and they will have the backing of Germany. This is the so-called “blank cheque/check.”\n\nThe Germans really did have no idea what the Austria-Hungarians are going to do. They’re just prepared at this point to support them. \n\nSuppose, now, that Austria-Hungary should invade Serbia – surely pan-slavic obligation would lead to a Russian invasion of Austria-Hungary. And indeed, there were German politicians who foresaw this. Yet, they told the Austria-Hungarians to go ahead anyway. Partly they were thinking that Russia’s monarchy was vulnerable to revolution – and in this they turned out to be correct – and partly they were thinking – or at least, the Kaiser was thinking – that they could not permit the assassination of Royalty. The Habsburgs were never so popular in Europe as at this moment.\n\nVienna took advantage of the situation to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, saying the Serbs had failed to suppress terrorism—they weren’t quite able to say yet that the Serbs had fomented terrorism—and demanded that they condemn anti-Austrian propaganda, dissolve the Black Hand, and seek out and prosecute Serbs involved in the plot, and include Austria-Hungary in these activities. The Serbs were given 48 hours. This was on July 23. \n\nSo then: the Serbs say all right, we agree to all of that as much as we can, “in keeping with the position of an independent country.” That probably means no A-H involvement in the investigations and the suppressions. Suddenly in European public opinion the Serbs look better – the A-H have overreached. \n\nBut Belgrade also goes ahead and begins mobilizing. They anticipate that Vienna will not be receptive. This is correct: In fact, within fifteen minutes of getting the response to the ultimatum, Vienna rejects it and begins mobilizing for war, on July 25.\n\nOn July 28, A-H declares war on Serbia. \n\nAt this point, the Germans are hoping Russia will sit back, for fear of a revolution and that the French will also not want to honor the alliance. But they’re wrong. \n\nNobody in the Entente saw Vienna as independent. And indeed it wasn’t; it needed Germany’s go ahead to act. So the Entente powers see that Germany is raring to go to war. \n\nOn July 28, Russia partly mobilizes, in districts neighboring A-H. \n\nThe Germans actually don’t want to go to war in all Europe. But the clock is ticking. The British would like to localize the conflict, but everyone sees this can’t be done anymore. The Germans decide therefore on mobilization to beat the clock.\n\nJuly 31, Germany mobilizes and \n\nAugust 1, Germany declares war on Russia. At this point it is clearly a European war, and one that Germany has launched without any real idea of how to wage it. But to a very considerable extent it is responding to public opinion and reflecting the psychology of encirclement prevalent among its leaders. \n\nAugust 1, France mobilizes\n\nAugust 3, Germany declares war on France, and invades Belgium. \n\nAugust 4: Britain has a debate about a war and declares war on Germany. The debate in Parliament uses the rationale that this is a war to defend British naval power, and therefore a limited war, but it is a war. \n\nAugust 6: A-H declares war on Russia. \n\nItaly at this point declares neutrality, and the Ottomans aren’t in it yet. Italy’s neutrality indicates an interesting point: none of these declarations of war is actually mandated by Alliance or Entente. The Triple Alliance was to defend the central powers in case of Russian attack—which didn’t occur. The Entente didn’t bind Britain. So despite all these maneuverings, you didn’t have a required going-to-war situation. \n\nWhy did they go to war? In France, as perhaps in Britain, it is a question of loyalty to the nation, though in Germany and A-H and Russia, it is also a question of keeping up the dynasty. In all cases, though they’re not obliged to go to war by their alliances, they count on their alliances in making the decision to go to war. And in all cases, they miscalculate the costs of doing so, of course. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Why war\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![Trafalgar Square, London, August 2, 1914](../media/trafalgar.jpeg)\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nNow, you’re looking at Trafalgar Square in London on August 2, 1914, with the Labour politician James Keir Hardie addressing an enormous crowd—opposed to war. And yet, two days later, British public opinion seemed entirely to support war, to have turned on a dime, because of the German announcement that they would invade Belgium and violate its neutrality. It doesn’t really seem terribly rational. Indeed, Britain didn’t even implement conscription right away, so great was the enthusiasm for war. One million British men entered the army between August and December of 1914, and the recruitment offices were overwhelmed. By 1914, 2.4m Britons had volunteered, which is 30 percent of British men in the eligible age group. There’s a tremendous emotional investment in the war.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Why war, 2\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/german_enthusiasm.jpeg)\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nHere’s a German demonstration in favor of war on the declaration. As one German Socialist representative in the Reichstag said, “I shall never forget the incredible enthusiasm of the other parties, the government and the audience, when we stood up to be counted.” The Socialists, like the Labour poltician Keir Hardie, were generally and in principle opposed to war, which fell hard on the working person. And yet, the power of nationalism, of the nation mobilized for war, overcame these scruples in the moment. Hatred of the enemy, and the enthusiasm for treating the enemy as a brute animal, were embedded in this enthusiasm, and would bear fruit in the very near future.\n:::\n\n:::\n",
