As we'll have occasion to talk about over the quarter, this is both true and only part of the story. \n\nIt is a very important part of the story---it's the part of the story that, for example, has a great deal to say about how the Second World War would be fought. But it's not in any respect the entire story.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Imperialism and nationalism\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n::: {.v-center-container}\n![](../media/archduke_car.png)\n::: \n::::\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n::: {.notes}\nOne way to think about the broader story is to go back to the origin of the war. This is one of those *Jeopardy* questions, btw---whose assassination, in which city, began the Great War? \n\nAnd when you're thinking about the importance of that person, in that place, you should be thinking about the empire in question---the Austro-Hungarian Empire---and the importance to it of the city---Sarajevo. \n\nA lot of us have, I think, a standard idea that imperialism -> WW1, but we might have to tease that out (competition, encirclement)\n\nReasons for empires\n\nrelation of nationalism to imperialismâ€”not just or even primarily of the metropolis but of the colonized peoples; nationalism as an anti-colonial force\n\nthese themes are going to be important in our course, in linking together many fronts, as tools of the belligerent powers &c\n:::\n:::\n\n## Imperial locations\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](his119_01_intro_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n## Imperial locations\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](his119_01_intro_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n",
