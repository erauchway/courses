In the city of Petrograd, the capital city, which had only recently changed its named from SPBG, some thousands of women workers, mainly in the textile industry, and other women gathered. They were demonstrating not only for International Women’s Day, but also against the bread shortages, that were common because of the ongoing war. You’ll remember that Russia was allied with France, and represented a vital Eastern Front against Germany and Austria-Hungary, but it was no better equipped to survive a four-year total war than any other country, and perhaps worse than some.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Peasant Riots\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/serfdom.png){width=\"1000\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nWith the loss of the war with Japan in 1905, many unhappy classes in Russia asserted themselves. The tsar’s regime was weak, couldn’t win a war; ought therefore to make way for a newer world. Many Russians in 1905, especially in cities, campaigned for civil and political rights, and for the tsar to share power with a legislature. Eventually the tsar acceded to these demands, establishing some rights and an elected legislature. This pacified many demonstrators, but not all, and throughout the countryside for the next couple of years there were a number of peasant riots against the landowners and burning of estates. And as you can see here, these peasants---even in a major industrial economy---were still working with fairly old-fashioned implements.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Last days of the tsar\n\n\n::::{.columns .v-center-container}\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.column-left}\n![](../media/russia_protests.png){fig.align=\"left\"}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.column-right}\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}\nDo you mean that I am to regain the confidence of my people, or they are to regain mine?\n\n:::{.flushright}\nNicholas II\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe Great War brought higher taxes, inflation, and borrowing from overseas, as it did elsewhere, but here, with an already weaker government, the war made situations much worse. There were in Jan--Feb 1917 many strikes indeed, and food riots. Here’s another demonstration from about that time.\n\nThus the tsar was increasingly threatened, and his response was increasingly to crack down with police and the army. The British ambassador said something to Nicholas about seeking a way to increase confidence; this was Nicholas’s reply. Which tells you something about his flexibility and understanding of the situation.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## International Women's Day\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/womens_day){width=\"1000\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo to return, then: The Women’s Day demonstrations start in a bad war winter, when there’s no food, and when the snow is so thick that you can’t even use the rail lines to bring coal in to fire boilers and keep buildings warm. People have to line up for food at those few places that have it. \n\nAnd yet, this day at the end of February happens to be warm, or warm enough to go outside. And it’s so successful that it becomes a multi-day demonstration. 200,000 workers eventually went out on strike---in a city that only has about half a million people. They marched through Petrograd; they march across the frozen Neva River, which separates the poorer from the richer part of town. Some of them throw rocks at police officers. They began to carry signs saying not only “Down with the War,” but also “Down with the Tsarist government.” \n\nThe Tsar orders the army out to stop the protests, and soldiers dutifully fired on the crowds, killing hundreds of people.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Soldier protesters\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/army_protests.png){width=\"800\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nBut then the army regiment---the same one that was ordered to fire on protesters---mutinied, and joined the protesters. And other soldiers joined them. Here you see them in the streets. The demonstrators began attacking prisons and police stations. The army isn’t full of radicals. But the women’s day activists aren’t especially radical either. They just want bread. And the soldiers think they have more in common with the protesters who want bread than with the men who ordered them to shoot them. \n\nThe parliament decided the time had come, and secured the cooperation of the generals in putting a resolution calling for the abdication of the tsar. On March 2 they established a provisional government, and Nicholas then abdicates. His son and heir is a hemophiliac and eleven years old. So Nicholas tries to pass the crown to his brother, who won’t have it. So then, after 300 years of ruling, there’s no more Romanovs to be tsar.\n\nThis was immediately quite popular. 9m soldiers and sailors mutinied, imprisoned or killed their tsarist officers.\n\nIn the cities, industrial workers organized, drove out foremen and managers, demanded control over their own wages and hours, and established committee control of the factories. Union membership swelled by millions. Throughout the army and the factories, these citizen-committees known as soviets began to make local rules for the factory floor, or the army unit. \n\nKeep in mind though, this is still Russia, not the Soviet Union. The soviets, like the Petrograd soviet, are local. The national government is a provisional government, run by a coalition. But! in April, a few dozen people gather at the railway station in Zurich, Switzerland.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Through Europe by rail\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = borders_14, fill = \"antiquewhite1\", color = \"burlywood3\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_buffer(borders_14, -6000), linewidth = 0.6, fill = NA, color = alpha(\"burlywood3\", 0.4)) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_buffer(st_union(st_make_valid(borders_14)), 6000), linewidth = 0.4, fill = NA, color = alpha(c(\"lightblue\"), 0.7)) +\n  geom_richtext(data = borders_14,\n                mapping = aes(X, Y, label = mylab),\n                size = borders_14$siz,\n                family = \"Lydian\",\n                fill = NA, \n                color = \"chocolate4\",\n                label.color = NA, \n                nudge_x = borders_14$nx, \n                nudge_y = borders_14$ny, \n                na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Europe during World War I\",\n    caption = \"Map made using R, ggplot, and sf by Eric Rauchway with data from CShapes.\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = disp_win_coord[,'X'], ylim = disp_win_coord[, 'Y'], expand = TRUE) -> p\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](h187_08_russia_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nZürich there is in the North of Switzerland, which is neutral in the war.\n\nThis train is a special train, which is going to travel north through Germany to the Baltic Sea, then on the ferry across to Sweden, then again by train up around the Gulf of Bothnia, and down through Finland---which is at this point the Grand Duchy of Finland, and part of the Russian empire. \n\nNow, we’re in April 1917. Just a few weeks ago, remember, the news broke that the German foreign minister, a man called Arthur Zimmermann, was trying to get the Mexicans to fight the United States. Now, Zimmermann has had another idea. This train, this train is his idea. Because the few dozen people he’s putting on this train are Russian Bolsheviks. Their leader, of course, is Lenin.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Bolsheviks\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n- \"bolshe\" is Russian for \"big\" (like Bolshoi Balley); thus, bolshevik means belonging to the majority, which they don't\n\n- a socialist, but a particular kind of socialist; no compromise with the old order or the other classes\n\n- \"vanguardism\"---a small group (say, a few dozen on a train) can start a revolution\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\nSo they’re socialists, that is, they believe in ending private ownership of the means of industrial production and putting the workers in charge. They just believe in hurrying to get there, unlike many other socialists of the time, and by hurrying they mean killing people.\n\nThey are also violently opposed to Russia taking part in WWI because it’s an imperialist war, and the people dying it are the workers dying for the rich capitalists. So they want an immediate end to the war, and then to move straight on to revolution.\n\nThese are the essential elements of Bolshevism, and they’re the reason Lenin’s in Switzerland. He has been exiled to Siberia himself; he’s seen his brother hang. So he left Russia, first for Austria-Hungary. When the war breaks out he gets arrested. Then, when the Austrians figure out that he’s potentially trouble for the Russians, they send him to neutral territory for the time being.\n:::\n\n## In or out of war\n\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](h187_08_russia_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nZimmermann sees Russia tumbling into revolution, and thinks, here’s an opportunity. He works out a deal to get Lenin into Russia, together with his cadre of Bolsheviks, and cause trouble. \n\nThe train route is set up. They reach an agreement, too, to seal the train, so the Bolshevik virus can’t get out into Germany, and Lenin can’t be accused of having anything to do with the Germans.\n\nMeanwhile, the provisional government in Russia is discussing how to handle the war. Lots of Russians want out. Some of the leaders think, but we pledged to stay in. \n\nThey ultimately reach a compromise, which they call revolutionary defensism. This means they’ll stay in the war, but they’ll try to rally left-wing movements around the world to pressure their governments to end the war.\n\nLenin gets a newspaper on his train---presumably through the seal---and is apoplectic. This is not at all what the Bolsheviks are for. Or rather, as Lenin himself puts it, shouting---and let’s be honest, he’s probably got a bit of cabin fever from being on that train all this time---“This is shit! Utter shit!”\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## At the Finland Station\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/lenin_finland.png){width=\"1000\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo he’s good and mad by the time he gets to the Finland Station---that’s the railway station in Petrograd to which trains from Finland come. He’s greeted by a crowd who’s happy to see him, then he goes off to a house nearby to begin plotting. He gives a stirring speech there, to his friends. We must not wait; we must start revolution now. \n\nPeople aren’t all that sure. But he publishes a version of it in the newspaper. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## April theses\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/pravda.png){width=\"400\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nSo in April he publishes his idea in Pravda, the provisional government’s newspaper, which is about bread, peace, and land---specifically, that there can be no compromise with the provisional government, nor with the capitalist warmongers; there must be immediate peace. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Bolsheviks in the streets\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/streets.png){width=\"1000\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nIn July, the Bolsheviks and some army units stage a rebellious demonstration. The provisional government calls out loyal elements of the army and shoots the demonstrators. They order the arrest of Lenin, Trotsky, and other leading Bolsheviks. But it doesn’t work; in the main because on the battlefield the Russian army continues to take heavy losses against the Germans. In October, a coup began. The Bolsheviks ultimately take charge. Trotsky bids farewell to the moderate socialists in the Provisional government, saying, “You are miserable bankrupts. . . . Go where you ought to be---into the dustbin of history.”\n\nAnd the Bolsheviks quit the war---the war on the Germans, that is. Then they begin to fight a war in the streets and in the fields of Russia, a civil war, to try to keep what they had won.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Allied invasion\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/polar.jpg){width=\"900\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe French and the British request their newly associated belligerent friends the Americans to invade Russia and put down the Bolsheviks. Wilson sends about 7,000 US troops to join a three-pronged Allied invasion---at Murmansk, Archangelsk, and Vladivostok.\n\nThe Murmansk Soviet has broken with the Bolsheviks; they’re moderates, they’ll help. \n\nAt Vladivostok, the tsarists had shipped a bunch of supplies, in the hope of shipping them out. Vladivostok, as well as most of the trans-Siberian railway, is held by the Czechoslovak Corps. They’re fighting the Bolsheviks in the hope of getting Russia back into the war. \n\nThe Japanese join them at Vladivostok, to hold there and to move along further into Siberia.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Protests\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![](../media/parrish.png){width=\"400\" fig.align=\"center\"}\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe Americans in the war, don’t want to be in this war. Sgt. Parrish writes in his diary, “We took 16 enemy prisoners and killed 2---then we burned the village & my heart ached to have the women fall down at my feet & grab my legs and kiss my hand & beg me not to do it.  But orders are orders.” He complains: “I drew up a resolution to request reason why we are fighting & why we haven't any Big Guns & why the English run us & why we haven't enough to eat & why our men can't get proper medical attention & some mail. . . . I was called up before the Colonel and he read the articles of War to me & showed where my offence was.  Punishable by death.  But I knew it any how.”\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Congress\n\n::::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}\nWe shot down Russian peasants and our boys are shot down by them.  No sooner had we landed at Archangel than we shot the Soviet government there, and set up a government of our own.  No sooner did we go into the interior than everywhere we found a local society we shot it to death and set up our own mode of government.\n\n:::{.flushright}\nSen. Hiram Johnson, R--CA\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nJohnson put a resolution asking why we were in Russia, how many were there, and where they were.  And a casualty list.  Johnson's measure is defeated only by Vice President Thomas Marshall's tie-breaking vote.\n\none newspaper reporter, Jay Hayden in the Detroit News, writes, “The history of the Russian intervention revealed to me by an American authority so high that it is beyond the possibility to question its accuracy, shows the position of the troops to be the result of one of the worst possible policy blunders of the war.”\n\nAnd he might have been exactly right. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n# The Sisson documents\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nFrom Kennan, The Sisson Documents\n\n130 David R. Francis, Ambassador to Russia, tells Sisson he got docs from a journalist in Petrograd. The State Department intelligence said no dice. But  Edgar Sisson, special rep of CPI in Petrograd.  Published documents in October 1918 in CPI War Information Series.  Bought them. \n\n132 J. Franklin Jameson -- history prof, Brown -- helps authenticate them.\nBut they were weaselly about just what they were authenticating, and Jameson did not read Russian, e.g.\n\n139 the letters from the Germans are written in excellent Russian, and signed using the Russian alphabet (Cyrillic).  Hmm.\n\n143 the documents purporting to come from Russians were typed on the same typewriters as documents supposed to come from Germans.  \"a clear indication of fraudulence\"\n\nThe British figured this at the time.\n\n151 attributes them to Anton Ossendowski, anti-German ant-Bolshie propagandist in Russia.\n\n134 So to believe this, you need to believe the Bolshevik leadership were working for the German general staff, and they managed to conceal this at the time and for decades after; that the German general staff actually dictated the intraparty elections; that the German general staff had two bureaus in Petrograd, operating under such security that no other source gives any hint of their existence; that Brest-Litovsk negotiations were w big ol fake.  \n\n135 note there were huge postwar investigations into the German breakdown, during which such materials would have come out\n\nIn 1919, the Bolsheviks established the Communist International, or Comintern, to try to coordinate and spread Bolshevism throughout the world. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Relief and stabilization\n\n:::{.v-center-container}\n\n\n\n\n```{=revealjs}\n<video width=\"600\" muted loop>\n<source src=\"../media/relief.mp4\">\n</video>\n```\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::{.content-hidden when-format=\"html\" unless-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n:::{.notes}\nThe revolution and dislocation led to catastrophic famines, as they often do. The American Relief Administration, led by Herbert Hoover still, provided relief; it was 90 percent of the relief sent to Russia, and is supposed to have saved ten million Russians from starvation.\n\nAnd yet, there was no formal diplomatic relationship between the two nations. The Soviets still pursued a strategy of promoting socialist revolution throughout the world, something to which the US (and other Western nations) were naturally opposed. They profoundly disliked the idea of the Russians intervening in their domestic politics. \n\nWith Lenin’s death in 1924, the Soviets’ posture began to change. Trotsky wanted to continue pursuit of world revolution. Stalin preferred the idea of “socialism in one country.” Stalin eventually defeated Trotsky for leadership within the party, in 1927, and sent him into exile in 1929. He would eventually move to Mexico, where he would live for a year until his assassination by Soviet secret police agents. \n\nAt this time the Soviet Union began to pursue a more superficially normal relationship to the nations of the world.\n:::\n\n:::",
