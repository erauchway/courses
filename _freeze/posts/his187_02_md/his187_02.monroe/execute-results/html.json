Alaska came by purchase; Midway simply by landing, as there was nobody living there except birds: it was and remains a small coral atoll. \n\nThe US acquired Hawaii in 1898, in the same year it acquired Guam. \n:::\n\n\n## The Navy and the Pacific Strategy\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"revealjs\"}\n\n::::{.v-center-container}\n![The Battle of Manila Bay, 1898](../media/manila_bay.png)\n::::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nThat was the year, 1898, of the Spanish-American War, which culminated at the battle of Manila Bay, shown here. This was a souvenir lithograph of the battle, showing US battleships in action.\n\nSo first, what's a battleship. How many battleships does the US Navy have on active service today? \n\nIn 1886, Congress first authorized the construction of US warships to be called \"battleships,\" mechanized shups with big guns. These would be the *Maine* and the *Texas,* thus establishing the convention that US battleships would be named for states. They weren't all that big nor did they have long range. But in 1890, Congress agreed to fund three more: *Indiana, Massachusetts,* and *Oregon.* All five were floated by 1896, and Congress authorized the sixth, *Iowa,* in 1897. So in 1898, the US Navy had six, brand-new battleships, which formed the basis of the c20 US Navy.\n\nWhat is a battleship for? Projecting power, as we euphemistically say. You drive it up alongside something you want to threaten, and it's very threatening, and people are more likely to do what you want them to do than they otherwise would be. Or, if necessary, you actually fire the guns---either at a target on land, like a fortified position, an enemy army; or at another navy's battleship.\n\nThe *Maine,* one of these brand-new battleships, was sunk while on duty in Havana harbor in 1898. Havana is in Cuba; Cuba was then a Spanish possession; US officials blamed Spain for the sinking of the *Maine.* And so the US went to war with Spain.\n\nDuring this war, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt ordered the Pacific Squadron---a group of much smaller, but equally modern, ships led by the cruiser *Olympia,* to Manila Bay in the Philippines. The Philippine Islands were also then a Spanish possession. The US Pacific squadron met the nominally superior, but much less modern, Spanish fleet in Manila Bay, and defeated it.\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/item/98504764/\n:::\n\n",
