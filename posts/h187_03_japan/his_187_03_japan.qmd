There's a bunch of things we could say about this, but this is the basic outline. And, as with the film clip I showed you, this is developed largely without the involvement of the American public; rather, these are the strategies and ambitions of a relatively small number of Americans. People like Roosevelt and Mahan, like Olney and Root---they are members of the power elite, or the ruling class; it depends on which sociological analysis you prefer. They share a certain world-view. It isn't a question of conspiracy, exactly, or even of class interest in the Marxist sense---we're not talking about what the owners of capital necessarily want. And in fact when there are public debates, as there are over annexing the Philippines, some big businessmen object, quite strenuously; notably the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. This is more of an elite-group formed by common schooling and attitudes toward power than the *per se* ownership of capital.

At around 1900, the US has, remember, a half-dozen battleships; this is at a time when Britain has about 45.

# Drivers of foreign policy

:::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::{.notes}
Remember, I suggested to you there is a variety of ways we can think about the drivers of US foreign policy, and that describing it as representing the interest of capital was difficult, because the capitalist class in the United States was so varied there were conflicting interests within it. One might draw a fairly bright line between capitalists in the industrial north and in the agricultural South or the extractive West and find there are very few interests that cross that line; the North is much more in favor of tariffs; the South in favor of free trade; the North in favor of more immigration; the West in favor of less---and so on.

So I also suggested to you that what we call "politics" is often a way of working out the conflicts between those sets of interests, especially when it comes to foreign policy.

But I also pointed out to you that the nature of US foreign policy has been remarkably consistent over long periods of time, no matter which party was in control, and shifts in attitudes---such as the shift in the attitude toward tariffs, which was a key part of twentieth-century foreign-policy development---come slowly and as a matter of epochal change.

And I've also suggested to you that this is because even with all the political conflict we have, we have historically---perhaps more reliably over the period we're studying in this class---had a singular elite group in charge of foreign policy. And I pointed out to you that there are sociological models for the formation of an elite, based on empirical studies of the US governing class---notably those of C. Wright Mills or G. William Domhoff---and that these are defined in opposition to Marxism, but still leave room for a discussion of the ruling class---a very small group indeed. And that's, for the most part, what we're looking at when we look at people like Alfred Thayer Mahan and Theodore Roosevelt or Elihu Root, and other major figures in the formation of US foreign policy at the turn of the twentieth century.

Which is how we got to this point, with the United States expanding its influence in the Caribbean and the Pacific both by conquest and by diplomacy or, in the case of Hawai‘i, a little of both. Remember, here, the aim of this Pacific policy is the China market. You should know from your reading that other colonizer powers also had an interest in the China market---don't forget, you should be reading the David Silbey book by now. And from it, as well as from other classes, you should by now know that the colonizer powers did not include only European nations, but also Japan. Japan was, like the United States, a rising power at the turn of the twentieth century, and thus an object of foreign policy concern for US thinkers and policymakers. Which is our topic for today: how US-Japanese relations in the first decade of the c20 led to a reversal of American ambitions in the Pacific.

American ambitions for a market in Asia had not always focused so exclusively on China. In the middle of the nineteenth century, US policymakers focused for a time on Japan. The island nation had for centuries pursued a policy of almost complete isolation, closing its seaports to all but Chinese and Dutch ships, and rigidly controlling the degree of contact between its people and outsiders.

In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry of the US Navy arrived in Tokyo’s harbor with the objective of forcing Japan to accept US trade, sailing a fleet including both steam and sailing vessels. The steam ships were big and, to many Japanese, terrifying. They had in their time of isolation lost touch with the world of modern technology and were unfamiliar with the ability of industrial manufacturing to produce modern machines of war. Perry took advantage of this.

Perry invited the Japanese to a dinner, where, as you can see, a centerpiece of entertainment was his ships’ cannon, the big guns providing a silent demonstration of American power. Perry said he wouldn’t leave the Japanese harbor until he got an agreement to open Japanese ports. The Tokugawa shogunate agreed, as they believed they had little choice, and opened Japanese ports to US ships, also granting US ships permission to resupply themselves in Japan if need be. Within a few years, Japan had signed similar treaties with other Western nations, and was on a rapid path to modernization. Many Japanese were simultaneously resentful and envious of the American and, more broadly, Western ability to get what they wanted by the use of modern technology, and they were determined to see their own nation similarly strengthened. Especially under the Emperor Meiji, who had been born the year before Perry’s arrival and who came to the throne in 1867, remaining there until his death in 1912, Japan pursued a policy of economic modernization. Not only did Japan pursue the policy of acquiring industrial might, but also the policy of seeking overseas colonies to supplement and supply its domestic economy. The logical place for Japan to pursue such territories was on the close-by Asian mainland.

In 1894, Japan went to war with China, its much larger but less successfully modernizing neighbor. The Japanese won a swift victory, and in the subsequent treaty took Taiwan (then known as Formosa) as well as establishing Korea’s independence from China. You can see, geographically, why Japan wanted to have a relationship with Korea. But in establishing the peninsula’s independence from China, Japan was in the near term successful only in opening the way for Russia to take control of Korea. Moreover, Japan’s establishment of China’s weakness opened the way for other, European powers to step up their attempts to take advantage of the weakened Chinese empire---which, again, is something you should be gleaning from your reading.

. . . and the Germans attempting to make inroads. All these powers are trying to take advantage of what they see as the untapped economic potential of China, without actually colonizing it. You can see, just from the map here, that it would be a daunting prospect to take over China completely; yet you can also see that there is a lot of land and you know there are a lot of people---about 400m---who might represent a vital source of economic benefit one way or another. China is at this point still under the rulership of the Q’ing dynasty, but as we’ve seen, it’s been unsuccessful in modernizing the economy---or at least, not as successful as Japan has been, across the water.

Moreover, the US was moving informally and culturally into China; of the 3,800 US missionaries overseas in 1900 or so, 3,100 were in China. The China trade for the US was small---still only about 1% of US exports at 1900---but 90% of what the Chinese bought was manufactured goods---that is to say, unlike Europe, which made its own manufactures quite well, China was the kind of market the Americans wanted. Of course, the other modern industrial powers thought similarly, hoping to sell their high-margin goods to the Chinese market.

Rage at the increasing influence of the foreign powers led in 1899 to the so-called Boxer Uprising, a revolt against foreigners from within China.

Anti-foreign organizations in China stockpiled weapons, then launched attacks, killing foreign missionaries, diplomats, and the representatives of railway companies who were trying to build in China. These organizations also targeted Q’ing officials, as collaborators with the enemy---but as the Boxers grew more successful, representatives of the government began to join them. They included mainly peasants, and a number of militant women’s groups as well. By 1900, the Boxers had besieged the compounds in Beijing where the foreign powers had their embassies. They killed the German minister. The European powers of Germany, France, Britain, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia, together with the US and Japan, sent troops to put down the rebellion. The US administration deployed troops who were stationed at Manila, in the Philippines, thus proving to the Americans the value of that base for the purpose of controlling China.

Perhaps predictably, because it was the closest of the eight nations, Japan sent the largest number of troops---some 20,000 as compared to some 2,000 from the US.

The Americans, recognizing their relative weakness in this situation, sought to take advantage of this momentary alliance among competing powers to declare a policy that would suit them. Secretary of State John Hay issued a note calling for “the equal treatment in trade and navigation for the commerce and industry of the United States and all other nations”. Japan welcomed this approach, replying, “the monopoly of interests in China by a few powers will be eliminated and the territorial integrity of China will be preserved”

In the wake of the Boxer rebellion, the foreign powers levied an indemnity against China, forcing it to raise \$318m to pay the colonizer powers for costs incurred in putting down the rebellion. Both the US and Japan wanted it reduced, worrying it would cripple the country they meant to be a source of profit for them. Indeed, Theodore Roosevelt ultimately decided to reinvest a substantial portion of the indemnity in scholarships, so Chinese students could study in America. This was a move intended to establish cultural links between the two nations, so as to further trade and alliances down the road. It was also an important way in which the US established itself as a competitor to Japan, which also sought to be a source of overseas education and modernization for Chinese pupils.

:::{.notes}
Remember, the Japanese government was only about half a century, and the Meiji rulership was only about 20 years, into the business of modernizing the government. It remained unclear exactly how this should be done. At first, as we've seen, Japan seemed willing to follow the Open Door example of the US. But in 1900 or so, one of the more powerful Japanese statesman, a man called Yamagata Aritomo, who had earlier established the custom of universal military service, now moved to ensure that only active-duty military officers could serve as ministers of the army and the navy, thus removing civilians from military control and putting generals and admirals in a position to serve on councils where military policy was made. One of Yamagata’s disciples, Katsura Taro, became Japanese Prime Minister in 1901, and Katsura selected Komura Juntaro, the man you see there in the photograph with TR, as foreign minister. Komura was, like TR, an alumnus of Harvard College. He was deeply immersed in American and British history and literature. And he believed that those traditions provided some clear lessons for Japan: that the nation must pursue its own interests and its own markets overseas. The open door was going to kill Japan, he believed; “our commercial capitalists have not yet reached the stage of development at which they could compete equally”

He noted, as many statesmen have, that the US did not pursue the Open Door in its own neighborhood---that is, the Monroe Doctrine, at least as restated by TR, was not an Open Door policy.

Thus a major shift in Japan away from the open door. Komura established an alliance with the UK in 1902, in which the UK recognized the special interest of Japan in Korea. This put Japan on a collision course with Russia, which had been using Korea for its own purposes. Komura approached Russia, seeking to do a deal, saying Japan would recognize Russia’s interests in Manchuria while Russia would leave Korea to Japan. But the Russians were unprepared to do so. But meanwhile, Komura had kept the British and the Americans apprised of his moves, and had their quiet approval. In fact, Komura sent one of his deputies to the US to begin talking to TR about how to end a war with Russia even as Japan began to start one.

Japan had also invested something like 10 to 20 percent of its national income in the military, as well as integrating the military into its government.

The US thus largely sympathized with Japan in its war against Russia. Despite his general racism, TR was keen on the Japanese; he thought that Russians were “a more serious problem” and “Russians and Americans . . . have nothing whatsoever in common.” At the same time, he did not want, as he wrote, the Japanese to get a “big head,” and especially did not want to see them able to “reorganize China.” So he wanted a Japanese victory over Russia, and Japan to have a sphere of influence in Asia, without it leading to outright conquest. Honestly, he hoped the two nations would “fight until both were fairly well exhausted.” He wanted to avoid “either a yellow peril or a Slav peril.”

The Japanese won swift victories over the Russians at both Port Arthur (on the peninsula, right above where it says Gulf of Pechili) and also inland at Mukden. Still, Japanese leaders knew they couldn’t proceed indefinitely; as would become a theme of the c20, there are a lot of Russians and a lot of Russia.

American enthusiasm for Japan was not only at the level of TR; it was also at the level of investors, who bought Japanese war bonds in America---they were looking for \$95m and got \$500m in just a few hours, for the house of Kuhn Loeb. Wall Street was suddenly a place where international diplomacy happened.

In a very short time, the Russians had moved thousands of troops West, using the Trans-Siberian railway, and the Japanese leaders knew their forces were in trouble on the mainland. They didn’t want to fight there. Miraculously, they won a naval battle over Russia’s Baltic Fleet in the Sea of Japan in May, putting them in a position to ask for peace. TR agreed to negotiate a peace. “What a wonderful people the Japanese are!” he exclaimed, saying also, “In a dozen years the English, Americans and Germans, who now dread one another as rivals . . . will have each to dread the Japanese more than they do any other nation.”

The absence of an indemnity led to a series of anti-peace riots, demonizing TR and Komura, in Japan. The Japanese public had been led by the rulers of their increasingly militarized society to expect nothing less than total victory, so even the considerable concessions won at Portsmouth looked like not enough.

American officials took these as warning signs. Roosevelt bulked up the US fleet in the Philippines, and also began to worry about reports from Hawaii, where Japanese-descended inhabitants outnumbered white residents.

Meanwhile, anti-Japanese sentiments grew among the public on the West Coast, where Japanese immigration had replaced Chinese immigration since the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1906, with many of San Francisco’s schools destroyed by the great earthquake, the SF Board of Education established school segregation for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean children---at a time when the Japanese Red Cross had just given an extraordinary sum of money, \$250k, for relief of earthquake victims. This spurred rage in Japan, and sentiment for sending warships to San Francisco. They didn’t, and TR was furious at the “idiots” in CA, and referred to the SF schools’ action as a “wicked absurdity.” He did another deal: the segregation would be rescinded in exchange for a Japanese promise to restrict immigration only to non-laborer relatives of laborers currently in the US. (so-called Gentlemen's Agreement) Concern grew that the US would have to go to war with Japan---that the US was hampered by having to patrol two oceans, while the Japanese could concentrate on the Pacific; that the Japanese might attack the still-unfinished Panama Canal.

In 1906, Roosevelt commissioned the first of the US official war plans---war plan Orange, for war with Japan. It concluded that if the Japanese were to launch an attack on US facilities in the Pacific, the US would probably have to give up the Philippines, retreating to Hawaii. The US presence in the Philippines, even though augmented, was still a weak point, and one the US simply could not afford to defend, or to supply, under conditions of attack from Japan. The Philippines, Roosevelt ruefully remarked, “form our heel of Achilles. They are all that make the present situation dangerous.” It was with this thought in mind that in 1907, Roosevelt sent the US fleet on a cruise around the world.

In December, 1907, Roosevelt assembled the US Atlantic Fleet---by now, sixteen battleships and various smaller ships---at Virginia, and sent them off around the tip of South America. They were painted white, for peacetime, and also perhaps white, for the white race. They sailed around the southern tip of South America, and arrived in San Francisco. Forty-four warships, total, stood in the harbor there in May, then departed for Japan, arriving in Yokohama on July 7, where Japanese schoolchildren in their thousands stood, singing the Star Spangled Banner. 

The exercise helped to underline the weakness of the US navy, even as it looked outwardly like a show of strength. The fleet had to borrow British coal, and the US found it did not have sufficient ability to service the ships on their trip around the world. 

In another clash between US and Japanese interests seeking to build railroads in Manchuria, the TR administration tried to negotiate an agreement with Japan. This time, Japan would only recognize the “integrity”---not the “territorial integrity”---of China. Roosevelt agreed to this, believing he had no choice; he didn’t submit it to the Senate, because he did not want peace riots of his own. He pulled US naval positions back to Hawaii. 

Admiral Mahan, the advocate of the big navy and the expansionist policies of the 1890s, now thought that Japan had become the end of them. He suggested drawing a line along the Hawaiian islands and use the Pacific fleet only to defend US interests East of that frontier. 

What would happen in terms of the US economy, which was supposed to be slaked by the markets of China, was a question left unanswered.
