    So last time we talked about imperialism and nationalism, and how the first one was the important force in motivating the war and the second one was the important one in motivating people to continue fighting for four years of brutal warfare. The nineteenth-century empires had the institutions that allowed planning for, and launching, war in coordination with allies; but they were multinational affairs, and loyalty to them was not very strong---unless it was framed in nationalist terms. So over the course of the war, it increasingly was. That worked, so long as you could persuade large populations they were members of the same nation. But often that wasn't possible, and the empires frayed around the edges as anti-colonial nationalisms grew stronger. If we had to pinpoint a singular reason for the importance of World War I in world history, this would be it: a shift from the age of colonial empires to the age of modern nationalisms. So today we're going to talk about those empires, and how they led the world into war.
