One of my plans for this course is to have a fair number of maps, and for you to be able to use them as an aid to thinking about US foreign policy, and also to learning the basics of some geography that is relevant to the course. 

If the map I show you is one that I made, it will be available to you on a course website I've set up, the URL of which is at the bottom of the screen here. It will appear sometime after class, so I can be sure it has in it the things I actually got around to showing in lecture, and not things I didn't. And because it won't have any material I didn't make---because of copyright---it won't replicate the experience of being in class. That is, it won't save you from taking notes. But it might serve as a useful outline, which you can fill in from your notes. 
And, as I say, it will have any maps and charts that I make. Like this one.

Let's consider first of all the projection (what's a projection) and why this one.

Then, let's do some fun iClicker.

### 1. Identify the northernmost point in the US

:::{.v-center-container}

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 14}
rland_a |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90", linewidth = 0.04) +
  labs(
    title = "HIS 187---WORLD MAP",
    subtitle = "Label the northernmost point in the US",
    caption = my_cap
  ) 
```

### 2. Identify the easternmost point in the US

:::{.v-center-container}

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 14}
rland_a |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90", linewidth = 0.04) +
  labs(
    title = "HIS 187---WORLD MAP",
    subtitle = "Label the easternmost point in the US",
    caption = my_cap
  ) 
```

### 3. Identify the southernmost point in the US

:::{.v-center-container}

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 14}
rland_a |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90", linewidth = 0.04) +

### 4. Identify the westernmost point in the US

:::{.v-center-container}

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 14}
rland_a |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90", linewidth = 0.04) +

    subtitle = "Label the westernmost point in the US",
    caption = my_cap
  ) 
```

## Compass points of the US

```{r}
rland_a |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(fill = "gray90", linewidth = 0.04) +
  geom_richtext(data = comp_lab, family = "Public Sans", aes(label = place, x = X, y = Y), size = 3, fill = NA, color = NA, text.color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "HIS 187---WORLD MAP",
    subtitle = "With US extreme points",
    caption = my_cap
  )
