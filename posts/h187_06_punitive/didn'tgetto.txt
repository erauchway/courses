When the last of them were ready to go, they set the supply dump on fire and sailed away; this photo shows the supplies burning on the shore. While the departing Allies destroyed the bulk of what they had left, the occupation of the cove for so many months meant there had been so many supplies left in various places, that the Turks were able to pick up innumerable boats, telegraph lines, medical supplies, water filters, small arms, munitions, and food. 

In the end the Turks lost perhaps 300,000 men at Gallipoli, while the Allies lost about 265,000. But the Turks held the peninsula, and the Allies failed. Perhaps its only success, as in so many of the slow-bleeding campaigns of the war, was in keeping some divisions pinned down here, instead of letting them go elsewhere—to the Caucasus, perhaps, to fight against the Russians, as the Russians feared.

The campaign made the reputation of Mustapha Kemal, who would afterward become Kemal Ataturk. It destroyed—albeit temporarily—the reputation of Winston Churchill, and the memory of it shaped Churchill’s strategy in the Second World War, including his wariness of staging amphibious landings against German strength in France. 

It also became a central moment in Australian memory. The nation of Australia was a new one, federated out of the six distinct states on the continent in 1901. The men who fought at Gallipoli had been born in New South Wales, in Victoria, or Queensland; but it was Australia that sent them to war, and it was as Australians they left Gallipoli.
