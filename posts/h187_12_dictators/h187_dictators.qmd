:::{.notes}
There's a certain kind of person who wants to say, for reasons to do with the present-day, that there was no real threat to the United States from Hitler's Germany. In its extreme form, this view comes in conspiracy flavors---Roosevelt lied to get the United States into the war because he wanted . . . something nefarious; usually to aid the Soviets or maybe to do away with the British empire or possibly to enthrone himself as dictator for life. In less extreme forms, it looks something like this---the belief that Roosevelt lied, but in a good cause.

It is my position that (a) it is very difficult to find Roosevelt actually lying. He was sometimes wrong about things. You can at most say he omitted things that he might have mentioned---but I'm not even sure there's a case of that when it's really significant. (b) Any argument that Roosevelt was trying to help the USSR founders on a simple fact: from September 1939 to June 1941---the period when Roosevelt is generally accused of being most deceitful---the USSR was allied to Nazi Germany, and therefore anyone who wanted to aid the USSR would not be pushing the United States to ally itself with Britain against Nazi Germany. (c) Roosevelt's anti-Nazi policy was really quite consistent over the entirety of his presidency, and varied only in intensity, correlated with the United States' ability to carry out a belligerent policy.

As a reminder from last time, these were some of the earliest foreign policy moves undertaken by the Roosevelt administration, and they were, as I said, internationalist in character; maybe more important, they were cautiously and to small extents in the character of organizing nations to oppose the advance of aggressor nations---Japan and Germany, particularly.

## Message for Hearst, 1/11/33

The ‘Buy American’ policy is all right today, as is also the high tariff policy [but] in the long run it would work against us. . . . [FDR] disapproves of the ‘Buy American’ campaign as a long-term policy . . . it would stifle all our foreign trade and would promote the erection of insurmountable tariff walls in other countries against us.

## Hitler is chancellor, 1/30/33


::::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}

the accession of Hitler was a portent of evil for the United States. He would in the end challenge us because his black sorcery appealed to the worst in men; it supported their hates and ridiculed their tolerances; and it could not exist permanently in the same world with a system whose reliance on reason and justice was fundamental

The accession of Hitler, to use FDR’s phrase, sharpens his views on the dangers in Europe. He’s had plenty of reason to worry (knows Germany, speaks German, reads Mein Kampf, hears from Jimmy Warburg, etc.)

## [Hitler's views of the United States, 1933]{.r-fit-text}


::::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}

All Europe is moving toward a hard fate if American expansionist economic activity is not stopped somewhere and some time. 

---

America has no choice but to wage an imperial policy all over the world. For the moment, Roosevelt hopes only to achieve ‘prosperity.’ But if he cannot make it come into being by peaceful means---and in this he will fail---then it can be coerced only by a war.

---

The natural process of selection has become an artificial one. The American Union strictly prescribes how a man must be constituted if he is to be admitted. What our bourgeois democracy does not understand is there prescribed by law.…If you want to mobilize Europe against this danger, you will … do it … only under the leadership of a state which acts consciously according to racial laws.

It’s pretty clear what direction Roosevelt wants to move in. At the same time, he has political pressures keeping him from moving that way. Not just the Hearstian elements among his electorate, but also, as we know, on the very same day he’s telling the French ambassador that the US, UK, and France must cooperate if civilization is to be preserved, the banks begin to shut their doors in state after state to prevent collapse. By the time Japan walks out of the League, it’s clear he’s going to have to go off gold. This is the way things go for a long time in FDR’s presidency. So although, for example …

FDR let it get out he was considering appointing a Jew, which got Nazi diplomats all hot and bothered and telling Americans they hoped FDR “will not embarrass us by presenting the name of a Jew.”  He considered appointing Newton Baker, whose wife was Jewish; Baker said no. An American diplomat, James McDonald, reported to him on what was going on in Germany, including Hitler’s plan to “get rid of the Jews,” and FDR “showing a very real grasp of the situation.”

## Shifts

- Monroe Doctrine -> good neighbor

- Colonialism -> independence
  - Tydings--McDuffie (Philippine Independence) Act, 1934
  - Organic Act for the Virgin Islands, 1936

:::{.notes}
So, we've talked about the first. The second two, we'll talk a little bit more about when we talk about the segue to the postwar period. But you should know that part of what Roosevelt does is try to build alliances in the Western hemisphere and, indeed, define the Western hemisphere as broadly as possible. 

You will also want to know that the Tydings-McDuffie Act provides for relinquishing the Philippines, and that the Organic Act provides rights for Virgin Islanders.

## Neutrality Acts

:::{.v-center-container}

- 1935

  embargo and travel-at-risk provisions
- 1936
  
  forbids loans or credits to belligerents

:::

:::{.content-hidden when-format="html" unless-format="revealjs"}

:::{.notes}
Roosevelt wanted the right to embargo “aggressor nations,” when he was president-elect—Congress didn’t want to give him that power, because they thought he would use it to embroil the US in conflicts with Germany and Japan. There followed a back and forth between Congress and Roosevelt over the use of neutrality as a foreign policy tool---at a time when, as we’ve seen, the US didn’t have much military power.

Roosevelt was obliged to find a state of war with Ethiopia; Lesson of 1935 law and Italian invasion of Ethiopia is that the neutrality legislation aids the stronger power.

## Chicago speech, 1937

:::{.callout-tip appearance=minimal .v-center-container}
The present reign of terror and international lawlessness began a few years ago. It began through unjustified interference in the internal affairs of other nations or the invasion of alien territory in violation of treaties, and has now reached a stage where the very foundations of civilization are seriously threatened. The landmarks and traditions which have marked the progress of civilization toward a condition of law, order and justice are being wiped away. . . . 

It ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era . . . any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk of plunging the whole world into war by invading and violating, in contravention of solemn treaties, the territory of other nations that have done them no real harm and are too weak to protect themselves adequately. Yet the peace of the world and the welfare and security of every nation, including our own, is today being threatened by that very thing.

> Without a declaration of war and without warning or justification of any kind, civilians, including vast numbers of women and children, are being ruthlessly murdered with bombs from the air. In times of so-called peace, ships are being attacked and sunk by submarines without cause or notice. Nations are fomenting and taking sides in civil warfare in nations that have never done them any harm. Nations claiming freedom for themselves deny it to others. It ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era, and in the face of experience any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk of plunging the whole world into war by invading and violating, in contravention of solemn treaties, the territory of other nations that have done them no real harm and are too weak to protect themselves adequately. Yet the peace of the world and the welfare and security of every nation, including our own, is today being threatened by that very thing.
