As we saw, Mossadegh, the duly elected and NOT COMMUNIST leader of Iran nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company in 1951. Truman didn't think there was a compelling interest there. But the Eisenhower administration did. Eisenhower, as you will know from your readeing,  approved the use of the CIA to overthrow Mossadegh, and the CIA drew up Operation Ajax, carried out largely by the CIA station chief in Tehran, Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson of Theodore Roosevelt. Ajax involved bribing military officers, legislators, and paying demonstrators to oppose the government. The goal was to overthrow Mossadegh, and to restore the former king of Iran, known as the Shah, to power.

When the CIA gave the signal to go in 1953, Mossadegh did not react weakly. In fact, he imprisoned dozens of the conspirators and cracked down on the protests. The Shah fled Iran. General Zahedi, the leading military figure in the conspiracy, went into hiding. The CIA in Washington ordered Roosevelt to stop. “Operation has been tried and failed and we should not participate in any operation against Mossadegh which could be traced back to the United States. Operations against Mossadegh should be discontinued.” But Roosevelt said, “no, we’re not done here.” He pushed forward with more hired crowds, paid by the CIA, and was able to get Mossadegh overthrown. Soldiers captured him at home.

So here you see the Shah on his way back from exile, and Zahedi returned from hiding, and no mention of the United States, let alone Kermit Roosevelt, in the coup that restored the Shah to power and deposed the democratically elected Mossadegh. Despite the CIA’s fears, apparently, Kermit Roosevelt was able to preserve the genteel fiction of the Americans’ lack of involvement.

Just to review: we have Iran, there---it's primarily a British concern, but the Eisenhower administration decides they need to take care of it. Truman's administration had been relatively unconcerned because of the trans-arabian pipeline carrying oil from the eastern side of the Arabian peninsula to the Mediterranean.

The British, though, are much more concerned about the Persian Gulf and the Suez Canal.

The Suez is in Egypt, which was a British dependency. There's a coup there in 1951, led by Nasser, and a transition to an authoritarian republic.

Nasser was, as you can see, a Pan-Islamist; he was also, though, a modernist and someone who wanted to do business in the world as he found it.

Nasser to Allen Dulles, 1953

:::{.content-hidden when-format="html" unless-format="revealjs"}

:::{.notes}
Nasser met Allen Dulles in 1953, at the start of the Eisenhower administration, and tried to persuade him that the US should just back off. The nationalists, like him, were not Communists, but they were anti-colonialists, and if the US stuck its nose in, he would have to oppose that.

He also realized, after Iran, that the US was quite likely to mess things up for him unless he had other allies as leverage. So he went to Tito, in Yugoslavia. He met the Soviets, too, so he could do a deal to buy weapons - he told Tito that it was a way of increasing his options.

Nasser believed that the way for a 3d world leader to operate was to ensure that he became a puppet neither to the East nor the West

In 1956 he established a constitution, and held not incredibly free, one-party elections, which he won, and then—

declared the Suez Canal to be the property of the Egyptian state, instead of the British empire. 

The British asked for American aid in regaining Suez, and Eisenhower said no: “the peoples of the Near East and of North Africa and, to some extent, all of Asia and all of Africa, would be consolidated against the West”—and thus vulnerable to the Russians. Also, remember, as of 1951, the US depended less on the Suez canal, because of Aramco's trans-Arabian pipeline.

The British decided to ignore this warning, and work out an alliance with France and Israel to go to war on Egypt

The agreement was that Israel would attack across the Sinai, thus necessitating the landing of British and French troops to protect the canal. This they did. Here you see the British landing.  The Eisenhower administration demanded a ceasefire. Eisenhower was angry, and negotiated a halt to hostilities. Egypt retained the canal, and Nasser remained a hero. Eisenhower demanded the Israelis leave or lose US aid, so they did.

One of the reasons Eisenhower had to side with Nasser, he believed, was that the outbreak of war afforded the Soviets a chance in the Middle East - Khrushchev offered to send troops “to enforce the peace”—jointly with the US if they would agree, and alone if not. Egypt would indeed remain socialist, though not communist. But also, as we've seen, here was an example of a time when the US didn't have a compelling economic interest in stopping nationalization. So it didn’t. Eisenhower was capable of permitting a non-Communist socialist to thrive when it suited him to do so.

## Consider now the banana

:::{.notes}
Consider the banana. The plant that grows it has no woody trunk or bough; it is therefore not a tree but technically, a grass. If you eat bananas, you know that you oftenest buy them unripe and then bring them home; they will, unlike some other fruit, ripen off the plant. So they are picked green and brought to the point of sale within 12 days or so—after that, it’s too late. 

As plants go, bananas are pretty temperamental. They require heat and lots of water, but they don’t like to stand in water. They need soil that drains well (i.e., not the clay of Davis). Florida might be perfect except it does have occasional frosts, which bananas can’t stand. They grow well in Israel and weirdly, Iceland—the hot geysers keep them warm enough. But they grow, generally, in the tropics, and particularly well on the Atlantic coast of Central America.

The plant grows from around 3 feet to twenty feet or so in height. They grow quite fast. It takes about ten months from planting to flowering, then another five months or so for the fruit to be ready for harvesting. 

There are lots of different kinds—straight ones, square ones, ones with seeds. But the one Americans came to know well—the one that appeared most often in stores by the middle twentieth century—

—was called the Gros Michel, or Big Mike. It was the product of a company called United Fruit, which tried a number of banana varieties and found that this one had a good thick skin, so it traveled pretty well, and it was big enough for a good-ish snack. United Fruit established plantations in the late c19 and began shipping the Big Mike to stores in American and European cities in the early c20. 

Nowadays, in Britain or America, we eat about seventy bananas per person per year. It is the world’s fourth major food commodity, after rice, wheat, and milk. 

When you eat a banana, you may have noticed it has no seeds. It is propagated by cutting and growing on plantations. As one science writer recently noted, “the banana has not had sex for thousands of years.” Its range of genetic variation is therefore pretty small. Because of that it is, in fact, getting attacked by lots of pathogens and pests that have evolved specifically to survive off the banana.

The Big Mike basically went under sometime in the 1950s. United Fruit came up with a new kind, the Cavendish—and that’s what we see in stores today—but it’s also suffering the same fate. Someday in the not very distant future, there may be no bananas, or anyway not bananas as we know them. Someday you will be old, like me, and saying to people, I remember bananas. What I’m saying is, bananas aren’t forever. They are an artifact of history, the product of a historical moment of human intervention. And they play a role in history.

As you’ll appreciate from this map, which comes from a book so is a little wonky, United Fruit had plantations in the Caribbean and in mainland South America, but mainly in Central America. In these nations, where as you know the US Marines would try to keep order through the early part of the c20, United Fruit had its own way of keeping order: if a local government didn’t do as it pleased, it would simply cease operations in that place and concentrate instead on another nation. No government, whether democratic or dictatorial, wanted to lose the business that United Fruit represented, so the nations of Central America would placate United Fruit, give it what it wanted, so it would stay around—much as US cities today do with NBA and NFL teams. 

Once, in Guatemala, a UF executive who was having trouble meeting with the local regime simply had his hotel pack his things and put the bags in the lobby. One of the president’s spies told him about this, and the president’s office swiftly rang up and arranged an appointment. UF ended up in control of railways. It paid hardly any taxes. It operated a large sector of Guatemala’s economy.

:::{.notes}
UF ran its businesses like a lot of monopoly firms, especially those operating in some kind of isolation. They had bunkhouses on their property, where their laborers lived. They paid low wages and they did not pay in cash; they paid in scrip for exchange at the company store—owned by United Fruit. So you would harvest bananas for United Fruit, you would sleep in a bed owned by United Fruit, you would be paid in currency printed by United Fruit, and you could spend it only at a store operated by United Fruit. 

Often, inasmuch as the company had plantations all around the tropical Caribbean and Atlantic coasts, they would ensure workers in one came from somewhere else. Quite often, for example, Guatemalan plantations were worked by Jamaicans. That way they had no loyalty, no family, no knowledge of the area. And if there was trouble, UF knew how to handle it. In the early c20, some Jamaicans were holding up work, complaining about prices at the UF store, and stealing goods instead of paying scrip. UF had a group of local Guatemalans lynch one of the leaders of the protests. They would call on the US government if they needed to, but they preferred not to do so.

In 1951, Guatemala elected Jacobo Arbenz to power. He was the son of a Swiss pharmacist who emigrated to Guatemala. He had been a military officer, a colonel. And at the time of his election, more than half of Guatemala’s population consisted of agricultural workers who owned no land of their own, while 90 percent or more of the nation’s land was in the hands of private companies, often foreign, like United Fruit. Arbenz came into office with the agenda of land reform. He would take away from private landholders any amount of land they had more than a certain acreage, and would give it to the poor.

That, Arbenz said, would be mistaking the means for the end. So he believed that the nation should “produce more wealth … But we must distribute these riches so that those who have less … benefit more, while those who have more … also benefit, but to a lesser extent. How could it be otherwise, given the poverty, the poor health, and the lack of education of our people?”

Arbenz himself had a lot of money—he had married into a rich family—and the Arbenzes said they would make their own plantation part of the plan of land reform.

United Fruit complained that this was communism, and took its case to the Truman administration, but the Truman administration did not worry too very much about it.

Allen Dulles offered the Guatemala job to Kermit Roosevelt, who turned it down, saying that in Iran, he had been able to drum up some reasonable facsimile of popular support but in Guatemala, he didn’t think it was possible. The army and the people, he said, had to “want what we want.”

The Eisenhower administration appointed as its ambassador to Guatemala a man called John Peurifoy, who was a pretty undiplomatic diplomat. He asked, as above, of Guatemalan officials on his arrival. He spoke no Spanish. He finally had dinner with the Arbenzes two months after arriving, and asked Mrs. Arbenz why when, in 1953, Stalin had died, the nation had declared a day of mourning. She replied that Stalin was a war hero, like Roosevelt and Churchill. Peurifoy disliked that answer. When the Arbenzes spoke of UF’s intransigence, Peurifoy said UF was too small to worry about. What he was concerned with was Communist infiltration.

Meanwhile, Arbenz proceeded with land reform. UF was apoplectic. For years, it had undervalued its land to avoid having to pay taxes on it. So now that the government was taking some of its land, it was giving UF only book value - the low amount UF had placed on the land for tax purposes.

As you can tell, it wasn’t an instant success. Guatemalan officers rallied to defend the government.

Eisenhower authorized CIA aircraft to bomb Guatemalan military bases, and the Army agreed to overthrow Arbenz. He went on the radio to tell the Guatemalan people that United Fruit had overthrown him - while the CIA tried to jam the transmission.

Che escaped to Mexico City, then to Cuba.

I hope you’ll remember Col. Batista, who helped overthrow Grau San Martin in 1933. He was elected president in 1940, then was out of office and seized power in a coup in 1952. He put himself up for election in 1954, running against Grau San Martin, and rigged the election, as well as using terrorism to keep his opponents’ supporters from the polls. 

Cuba was, as you see, rich where it was rich, and that was mainly where American tourists could swim, dance, or gamble—Havana then was much like Las Vegas today, only it was much more controlled by the US mafia. 

The US had supplied Batista. It was he of whom a State Department official said, “he may be a son of a bitch, but at least he is our son of a bitch.” And US support was widely known in Cuba.
