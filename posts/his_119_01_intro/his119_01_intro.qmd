## The Great War in popular memory

So, when we think of the Great War we mostly think of this kind of imagery---this is the kind of thing you would have seen if you saw the Oscar-winning movie *1917,* or the documentary made by Peter Jackson, *They Shall Not Grow Old.* It's the imagery of the Western Front of the war---mostly in France, a little in the Low Countries---and it's a landscape of trenches, tanks, poison gas, machine guns, and barbed wire. As we'll have occasion to talk about over the quarter, this is both true and only part of the story. 

It is a very important part of the story---it's the part of the story that, for example, has a great deal to say about how the Second World War would be fought. But it's not in any respect the entire story.

## Imperialism and nationalism

One way to think about the broader story is to go back to the origin of the war. This is one of those *Jeopardy* questions, btw---whose assassination, in which city, began the Great War? 

And when you're thinking about the importance of that person, in that place, you should be thinking about the empire in question---the Austro-Hungarian Empire---and the importance to it of the city---Sarajevo. 

A lot of us have, I think, a standard idea that imperialism -> WW1, but we might have to tease that out (competition, encirclement)

Reasons for empires

relation of nationalism to imperialismâ€”not just or even primarily of the metropolis but of the colonized peoples; nationalism as an anti-colonial force

these themes are going to be important in our course, in linking together many fronts, as tools of the belligerent powers &c
