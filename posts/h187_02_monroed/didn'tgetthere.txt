Here’s a map of SA in 1892 or thereabouts. If we zoom in (CLICK) on the north coast, we’ll see the region of Guiana, and particularly the westernmost portion, British Guiana.

As you can see here, the British claimed much more for Guiana than their neighbors to the West, the Venezuelans, would have liked. Venezuela was an independent republic, and had won its independence from Spain in 1811 and had had to go to war again to do is for sure in 1823. This boundary dispute continued for quite some time. Finally, in 1895, the US administration of Grover Cleveland sought to intervene.

There's a bunch of things we could say about this, but this is the basic outline. And, as with the film clip I showed you, this is developed largely without the involvement of the American public; rather, these are the strategies and ambitions of a relatively small number of Americans. People like Roosevelt and Mahan, like Olney and Root---they are members of the power elite, or the ruling class; it depends on which sociological analysis you prefer. They share a certain world-view. It isn't a question of conspiracy, exactly, or even of class interest in the Marxist sense---we're not talking about what the owners of capital necessarily want. And in fact when there are public debates, as there are over annexing the Philippines, some big businessmen object, quite strenuously; notably the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. This is more of an elite-group formed by common schooling and attitudes toward power than the *per se* ownership of capital.
