Course aims include the standard graduate seminar goals of developing participants' ability to analyze and criticize arguments, including especially an understanding of sources and methods; also the more practical goal of learning how to present such analysis and critique to best effect. You should finish the seminar with a reasonably good foundation for further reading for your comprehensive examinations, and also for constructing a survey course in twentieth-century US history.[Please note the date of the version of the syllabus you are reading; if it is before the start of the term it is quite likely there is a more recent version available.]{.aside}\n\nThis seminar meets weekly on Monday afternoon, 3:10--6:00 p.m., in Social Sciences room 4217.\n\n# Course calendar\n\nYou should ensure you have access to the required reading (please see the list below) and that you have read it thoroughly prior to the class meeting for which it is assigned in this calendar. You should come to class prepared to discuss the authors' arguments, sources, and methods of analysis and presentation, and in seminar you should pose questions and propose answers and otherwise participate actively. You should complete work as assigned. [If you do not already have a short shelf of texts on how to write, and specifically how to write history, you might begin to accumulate one before this course starts. Style guides include the old classics, like Strunk & White, *The Elements of Style,* as well as *Dreyer's English,* a recently published instant classic. On the conduct of history you might begin with Bloch, *The Historian's Craft.*]{.aside} \n\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-colwidths='[20,80]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Date        |Assignment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|October  2  |*Immigration, ethnicity, and the state in the 1920s.* Read McGirr; Kraut, chapter 4; Sweet. Write a review of McGirr appropriate for an academic journal of history. Consult the review section of recent issues of the *Journal of American History* or the *American Historical Review* to get a sense of what a such a review might sound like. These journals are often quite strict about word limits, so for this assignment please assume that your review can run a maximum of 500 words. Please format the description of the book and your byline as appropriate for the journal.              |\n|October  9  |*The New Deal: politics & policy.* Read Rauchway; Morgan; Leuchtenburg; Davies on 1940; Hannsgen & Papadimitriou; Hausman, Rhode, & Wieland; Williams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|October 16  |*Black Voters & the New Deal Coalition.* Read Grant; Thurston. Write a review essay considering these books together. Look at some essays in *Reviews in American History* or the *Times Literary Supplement* to familiarize yourself with this genre. Reviewers often begin by setting out an appropriate theme that unites the books under review in a way accessible to non-readers, then discuss how each of a few books address that theme. In an essay of 2,000 words, please do the same for these two books. Format the essay as would be appropriate for *Reviews in American History.*         |\n|October 23  |*Mobilization for war.* Read Wilson; Guglielmo; Katznelson, Geiger, & Kryder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|October 30  |*End of war.* Read Gallicchio; Asada; Bernstein; Hasegawa & Asada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|November  6 |*McCarthyism.* Read D. Johnson; Schrecker; Olmsted.[You might note that I have assigned a couple of articles by scholars from this department. As a general rule you should familiarize yourself more broadly with the scholarship of professors in the department where you are studying for your PhD, if for no other reason than that it will serve you well in preparing for your comprehensive examinations to know your examiners' opinion of the field.]{.aside}                                                                                                                                  |\n|November 13 |*Civil rights.* Read K.

Write a review of the Belew book in the style of a newspaper book review.

Consider that you are writing as a scholar with expertise in the field, while addressing a general, educated audience with an interested in the subject.

Your review should run about 1,500 words. |\n|December  4 |*Americans & others.* Read Lee; Serwer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n[Links appear in this list for readings that can be found only online.
